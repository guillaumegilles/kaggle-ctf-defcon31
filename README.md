## Overview

The popular and competitive game, Capture the Flag (CTF), isn't only played outdoors. A digital CTF refers to a set of challenges or puzzles that require participants to exploit vulnerabilities, solve problems, or uncover hidden information within computer systems, software, or networks.

In this competition, you'll interact with 27 hand-crafted machine learning security challenges to find flags, solve puzzles, and gain hands-on experience with concepts of AI security and safety. Every challenge is worth 1 point, so don't worry about starting late, just dive in!

## Description

CTFs are puzzles meant to challenge you and help you learn new things. Sometimes they may be a little ambiguous or misleading. That's part of the challenge! Once you successfully solve a challenge, you’ll capture a "digital flag" (a unique-to-you string). Save that flag, then upload it to receive credit and move up the Kaggle leaderboard.

Feel free to drop questions in the Kaggle Discussion forums, but don’t share code or spoilers! Please do not try and hack any infrastructure or share flags. Any teams found sharing flags will be disqualified. For help, contact us on Discord or use the Kaggle discussion board.

Competition host [AI Village](https://aivillage.org/large%20language%20models/threat-modeling-llm/) is a community of hackers and data scientists working to educate the world on the use and abuse of artificial intelligence in security and privacy. They aim to bring more diverse viewpoints to this field and grow the community of hackers, engineers, researchers, and policymakers working on making AI safer. They believe that we need more people with a hacker mindset assessing and analyzing machine learning systems. They have a presence at DEFCON, the world’s longest-running and largest hacking conference.

Winners will be asked to share their notebooks. Checkout the [starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/moohax/ctf-starter-aiv)!

## Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this competition is simple cumulative scoring. Each solve of a challenge is worth 1 point. Some challenges are materially harder, so expect variability in how long each challenge takes!

Each challenge will provide a unique flag, please respect the spirit of the competition and do not share flags. T**eams found sharing flags or using shared flags will be disqualified**!
